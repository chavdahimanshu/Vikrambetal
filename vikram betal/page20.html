                        &emsp;&emsp;In this story, there were three thieves named Harichand, Govind, and Keshav. One day, they planned to rob a wealthy merchant who lived in a nearby town. They devised a plan to enter the merchant's house at night and steal his treasures.

                            &emsp;&emsp;As the thieves sneaked into the merchant's house, they accidentally made a noise, waking the merchant. The merchant quickly realized that thieves were in his house, so he pretended to be asleep and overheard their conversation. The thieves, not noticing that the merchant was awake, began to argue.

            &emsp;&emsp;Vikramaditya replied, "The story teaches us that unity and cooperation lead to success. When people work together harmoniously, they can achieve great things, but greed and discord can lead to their downfall."

                        &emsp;&emsp;When Betal finished narrating this story, he posed a question to King Vikramaditya: "What could the magician have done differently to avoid his downfall?"

Instead of resorting to evil means, he could have supported his daughter's marriage and found fulfillment in her happiness."

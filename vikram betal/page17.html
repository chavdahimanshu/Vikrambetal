            &emsp;&emsp;In this story, a wise and charitable king named Vikramaditya promised a monk that he would capture a Betal (a spirit) and bring it to him. The condition was that the king must remain silent during the journey back, no matter what the Betal says. If the king speaks, the Betal would return to his hiding place.

        <b>
            &emsp;&emsp;King Vikramaditya, determined to keep his word, set out to capture Betal. He found Betal hanging on a tree in a cremation ground. As the king carried Betal on his shoulders and began his journey, Betal started narrating a story.

    <p>
        <b>
            &emsp;&emsp;Betal told the king about a Brahmin who came across a talking skull in a cremation ground. The skull was inhabited by a spirit who told the Brahmin stories to pass the time. One of the stories was about a rich man who buried his wealth in a field and died before revealing its location. The Brahmin, tempted by greed, decided to find the hidden treasure.

        <b>
            &emsp;&emsp;As the Brahmin dug the field, he found the treasure chest. However, he was seized by a group of thieves who intended to take the treasure for themselves. The thieves decided to kill the Brahmin, but he used his wit to escape death and trick the thieves.

    </p>
    <p>
        <b>
            &emsp;&emsp;After narrating the story, Betal asked King Vikramaditya a question related to the tale. Despite knowing the answer, Vikramaditya couldn't resist the urge to respond. He spoke out, saying that the Brahmin should have kept quiet and escaped the situation silently.
            
        </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>
            &emsp;&emsp;As soon as the king broke his silence, Betal flew back to the tree, his hiding place, leaving the king to begin his quest all over again.

        <b>
            &emsp;&emsp;And thus, the cycle of stories continued with each attempt by King Vikramaditya to capture Betal leading to a new tale and a new challenge.

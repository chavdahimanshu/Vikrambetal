                &emsp;&emsp;In this story, there was a barber in a small village who was renowned for his wit and cleverness. One day, he overheard a group of ministers discussing the king's plan to build a new palace. The ministers were concerned about the construction cost and suggested that the king consult the clever barber, who was known for his intelligence.

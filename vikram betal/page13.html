                            In this story, a poor Brahmin named Somsharma lived with his wife and children. One day, he met a sage who gave him four magical pills. The sage explained that each pill could grant him a wish, but he must use them wisely. Somsharma took the pills and went home.

                            Somsharma's wife wanted to test the pills and asked him to wish for a grand feast. Somsharma used one pill, and instantly a lavish feast appeared before them. Impressed, his wife persuaded him to use another pill to build a magnificent palace. He agreed and used the second pill, and a beautiful palace emerged.

                            Now, a wicked minister in the kingdom heard about the magical pills and wanted them for himself. He devised a plan and convinced the king that Somsharma was a threat to the kingdom and needed to be captured.

                            Somsharma was arrested and brought before the king. The king ordered him to hand over the magical pills, but Somsharma refused. The king threatened him with death, but Somsharma, in a moment of desperation, swallowed the third pill. Instantly, he disappeared from the king's court.

                            Somsharma reappeared in his home, and his wife, seeing his distressed state, convinced him to use the final pill to escape the kingdom. Somsharma agreed and used the last pill to transport himself and his family to a distant land.

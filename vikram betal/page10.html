    <h1 align="center">10. The Story Of The Hidden Treasure</h1>
    <hr>

        <b>
            &emsp;&emsp;Once upon a time, King Vikramaditya was visited by a sage who handed him a letter. The sage explained that the letter was from a hermit who lived deep in the forest. The hermit needed the king's help in locating a hidden treasure.

            &emsp;&emsp;King Vikramaditya, known for his valor and sense of duty, set out on a journey to the forest. He reached the hermit's hut and learned that the treasure was hidden in a graveyard under a specific tree. The hermit warned the king that he must retrieve the treasure alone and without uttering a word. If he spoke, the treasure would disappear.

                        &emsp;&emsp;As King Vikramaditya approached the tree in the graveyard, he noticed that there was a corpse hanging from one of its branches. Being a compassionate king, he couldn't help but wonder why the dead body was left there without a proper burial. He decided to bring it down and cremate it with full honors.

                        &emsp;&emsp;As he carried the corpse on his shoulder to a cremation ground, the corpse suddenly spoke. It was none other than Betal, a supernatural being. Betal told the king that he had tricked him into speaking, and as a result, he was bound to return to the tree. However, Betal was impressed by the king's compassion and decided to tell him a story during their journey back.

        <b>
            &emsp;&emsp;Vikramaditya agreed to listen, and Betal began narrating a story. This pattern of Betal telling a story and then posing a tricky question to the king continued for 24 stories. After each story, Betal would ask the king a question, and King Vikramaditya would answer. However, each time the king answered, Betal would fly back to the tree, forcing the king to retrieve him.

                        &emsp;&emsp;This cycle repeated until the 25th story, where Betal asked a particularly challenging question about dharma (duty and righteousness). King Vikramaditya answered the question correctly, but he was deeply perplexed. Betal commended him for his wisdom and flew back to the tree. The king retrieved Betal one final time, and this time, Betal acknowledged the king's wisdom and promised not to return.

                        &emsp;&emsp;One day, a notorious thief named Sagarchand visited the kingdom. He heard of the princess's reputation for honesty and decided to test her. Disguised as a sage, he approached the princess and handed her a valuable necklace, claiming that he was entrusting it to her care.

        <b>
            &emsp;&emsp; The princess, unaware of the sage's true identity, accepted the necklace and promised to protect it with her life. She wore the necklace around her neck and continued with her daily activities.

        <b>
            &emsp;&emsp;As days passed, the thief observed that the princess wore the necklace without any hesitation, and it became clear that she would not part with it easily. He knew that stealing the necklace directly would be too risky, so he devised a cunning plan.

        <b>
            &emsp;&emsp;Sagarchand approached the princess again, this time in the guise of a servant. He told her that he had a secret message from her father, the king, and he needed her to meet him in a secluded garden. The princess, trusting the servant, followed him to the garden, leaving the necklace behind.

        <b>
            &emsp;&emsp; Once they were alone in the garden, the servant revealed his true identity as the thief Sagarchand. He demanded the necklace from the princess. Chandraprabha, being honest and straightforward, told him the truth. She said that she had left the necklace in her room and would fetch it for him.

        <b>
            &emsp;&emsp;The thief, impressed by her honesty and trustworthiness, was filled with remorse for his actions. He realized that he couldn't deceive such an honest and innocent person. He confessed his true identity and intentions to the princess and returned the necklace to her.

        <b>
            &emsp;&emsp;The princess, displaying her remarkable kindness, forgave the thief and asked him to change his ways and lead an honest life. The thief was deeply moved by her compassion and promised to give up his life of crime.

            &emsp;&emsp;King Vikramaditya, who had been observing these events from a distance, was impressed by the princess's unwavering honesty and the thief's transformation. Once again, he captured Betal, the ghost, on his back and continued his journey with valuable lessons learned.

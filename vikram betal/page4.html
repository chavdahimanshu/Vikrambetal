              &emsp;&emsp;Once upon a time, in a kingdom ruled by a wise and just king,
              there were four princesses. These princesses were known throughout
              the land for their extraordinary beauty and grace. They were not
              just beautiful on the outside but also kind and virtuous.

              &emsp;&emsp;One day, the king decided that it was time for his daughters to
              get married. He summoned the four princes of neighboring kingdoms
              and arranged a grand Swayamvara (a ceremony where a princess
              chooses her husband from among eligible suitors) for his
              daughters. The Swayamvara was to be held on four consecutive days,
              with each princess choosing her husband one by one.

              The Swayamvara began, and the first princess chose a prince who
              was known for his intelligence. The second princess chose a prince
              renowned for his strength and valor. The third princess chose a
              prince famous for his musical talent, and the fourth princess, the
              youngest of them all, chose a prince celebrated for his humility
              and kindness.

              &emsp;&emsp;The weddings were celebrated with great pomp and splendor.
              However, soon after the weddings, a strange incident occurred.
              Each prince fell seriously ill and seemed to be near death. The
              king was deeply worried and consulted his ministers and
              astrologers. They concluded that the sickness was a result of some
              curse or evil influence.

          <p>
            <b>
              &emsp;&emsp;Word of the princesses' predicament reached the ears of a
              wandering sage who was passing through the kingdom. The sage
              offered to help and asked to see the four princesses. He
              discovered that each princess had a unique curse on her that was
              affecting her husband. The sage revealed that the curses were the
              result of the princesses' past lives, and they could only be
              broken if certain conditions were met.

        In this story, a poor oilman once found a small box containing a costly
        necklace. Instead of keeping it, he decided to gift it to the king,
        Vikramaditya. The king was pleased with the oilman's honesty and gave
        him a bag of gold coins in return. </b
      ><br /><br />
      &emsp;&emsp;<b>
        The oilman was on his way home, and on the same route, he met a Brahmin
        who asked him for some money. The oilman, being generous, gave him a
        gold coin. The Brahmin, however, was not satisfied and demanded more.
        When the oilman refused, the Brahmin decided to go to King Vikramaditya
        and claim that the necklace was stolen from him.

            The Brahmin went to the king and accused the oilman of theft. The
            king, being wise and just, decided to investigate the matter. He
            asked both the Brahmin and the oilman to present their case. After
            hearing both sides, the king realized the truth and decided in favor
            of the oilman. </b

          &emsp;&emsp;Betal, who had been silently listening, was impressed by
          the king's fairness and honesty. He revealed himself to Vikramaditya
          and praised his wisdom. However, Betal also warned the king that his
          biggest challenge was yet to come.

          &emsp;&emsp;Betal then flew back to the tree, and the cycle of stories
          continued with Vikramaditya's pursuit of Betal to keep him on his
          shoulder and reach the sage.

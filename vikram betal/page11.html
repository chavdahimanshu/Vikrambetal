            &emsp;&emsp;Once again, King Vikramaditya was summoned by the sage to perform a task. This time, the sage gave the king a special fruit and told him to take it to a particular Brahmin who was renowned for his selflessness and generosity.
        </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>
            &emsp;&emsp;King Vikramaditya followed the sage's instructions and arrived at the Brahmin's house. He presented the fruit to the Brahmin and explained the sage's message. The Brahmin, who was indeed known for his charitable nature, thanked the king and accepted the fruit. He decided to share the fruit with his family.
        </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>
            &emsp;&emsp;As the Brahmin was about to cut the fruit, a dazzling light emerged from it, and to his astonishment, he found a precious gem inside instead of the fruit. The gem was worth a fortune, and the Brahmin was overjoyed. However, his joy was short-lived as he quickly realized that the king, who had brought him the fruit, would assume that he had deceived him into giving away the gem.
        </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>
            &emsp;&emsp;The Brahmin, being an honest man, decided to visit King Vikramaditya to explain the situation. He went to the palace and told the king the entire story, including the unexpected transformation of the fruit into a gem. The king was impressed by the Brahmin's honesty and integrity and asked him to keep the gem.

    <p>
        <b>
            &emsp;&emsp;Just as the Brahmin was leaving the palace, Betal, the ghost, emerged from the king's shoulder and said, "Oh King, you have been tested. You knew the Brahmin was honest, yet you intended to take the gem back from him. Is this the way a just and righteous king should behave?"

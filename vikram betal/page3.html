                       Once upon a time, in a small village, there lived a farmer named Haridas. Haridas was a hardworking and honest man who struggled to make ends meet for his family. One day, he faced a terrible crisis. His daughter fell seriously ill, and he needed money to pay for her medical treatment. Desperate and with no other option, Haridas decided to borrow money from a cunning moneylender named Gopal.

                        Gopal agreed to lend Haridas the money, but he imposed an exorbitant interest rate, making it nearly impossible for Haridas to repay the debt. Haridas had no choice but to accept the terms, as he couldn't let his daughter suffer.

                        Years passed, and Haridas worked tirelessly on his farm to repay the debt. He toiled day and night, but the interest continued to accumulate, and the principal amount seemed unreachable. The moneylender, Gopal, had no sympathy for Haridas and constantly harassed him for the money.

                        One day, Haridas couldn't bear the burden any longer. He decided to leave the village and start a new life elsewhere, hoping to escape the moneylender's clutches. He left in the dead of night with his family, leaving everything behind.

                        As Haridas and his family journeyed through a dense forest, they encountered a strange sight. Hanging from a tree was a corpse, swaying in the wind. Haridas knew that he had to do something. He climbed the tree, cut the body down, and performed the last rites, offering prayers for the departed soul.

                        To his astonishment, the corpse transformed into Betal, the mischievous spirit. Betal grinned and said, "You have done a noble deed by giving a proper farewell to a departed soul. Now, I shall reward you. You may take any of my possessions that you find on this tree."

                        Haridas looked around and saw many valuable items hanging from the branches. He chose a beautiful necklace and brought it back to his family. Little did he know that the necklace had magical powers.

                        When they reached a new village and tried to sell the necklace, they discovered that it was worth a fortune. With the money from the necklace, Haridas was not only able to pay off his debt to the moneylender but also provide for his family's needs and secure their future.

                        Upon hearing this story, Betal turned to King Vikramaditya and asked, "King Vikram, what do you think of Haridas' actions? Was he right to abandon his debt and start anew?"

                    <b>
                        Remembering the condition set by Betal, King Vikramaditya remained silent, contemplating the moral dilemma. Betal then flew back to his tree, leaving the king to ponder the lesson of the story. The story teaches us the importance of compassion, doing the right thing, and the consequences of greed and exploitation.

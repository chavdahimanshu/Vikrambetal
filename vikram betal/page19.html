            &emsp;&emsp;In this story, there was a thief named Dhan Chor (which translates to Wealth Thief). Despite his profession, Dhan Chor had a strict code of conduct: he never stole from the poor or committed violence during his thefts. He only targeted the rich and corrupt.

        <b>
            &emsp;&emsp;One day, Dhan Chor witnessed a poor Brahmin praying to a goddess. The goddess appeared before the Brahmin and promised to fulfill any wish he had. The Brahmin, being wise and kind-hearted, asked the goddess to bless him with prosperity.

        <b>
            &emsp;&emsp;The goddess, pleased with the Brahmin's selfless wish, told him about a hidden treasure in a nearby forest and instructed him to take it. However, she warned him not to tell anyone about the treasure, except for his wife. The Brahmin followed the goddess's instructions, and he and his wife became wealthy.

        <b>
            &emsp;&emsp;Over time, people noticed the Brahmin's newfound prosperity and became suspicious. They reported him to the king, who ordered his soldiers to investigate. The soldiers tortured the Brahmin until he revealed the source of his wealth.

            &emsp;&emsp;Dhan Chor, who was eavesdropping on the soldiers, overheard the story and realized the injustice. He decided to help the Brahmin by confessing to the crime. He revealed that he was the thief who had stolen the treasure and that the Brahmin was innocent.

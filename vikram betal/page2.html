      &emsp;&emsp;<b>Once upon a time, in the city of Ujjain, there lived a scholarly man
        named Dharmaswami. He was renowned for his knowledge and wisdom. One
        day, he received an invitation from King Vikramaditya to visit his
        palace.</b><br /><br>
        &emsp;&emsp;<b> Dharmaswami was delighted and immediately accepted the invitation. He made
        his way to the palace, where he was welcomed with great honor by King
        Vikramaditya. They spent hours discussing various subjects, and the king
        was impressed by Dharmaswami's intellect.</b><br><br>
      &emsp;&emsp;<b>As the evening approached, King Vikramaditya said, "Dharmaswami, I have a request. I've heard of your vast knowledge, and I want you to solve a riddle for me. In the forest near my kingdom, there is a tree with magical fruits. The tree bears only two fruits each year, one in the day and one at night. The day fruit is sweet as nectar, but the night fruit is as bitter as poison. I want you to find a way to pluck both fruits without them turning bitter."</b>

            <p align="left">&emsp;&emsp; <b>Dharmaswami pondered over the riddle and agreed to take up the challenge. 
            He spent days studying books, consulting other scholars, and even conducting experiments, 
            but he couldn't find a solution. The riddle continued to baffle him.</b><br><br>
            &emsp;&emsp; One night, while deep in thought, Dharmaswami had a realization. He believed he had found the answer to the riddle. Excited, he immediately went to the palace and explained his solution to King Vikramaditya.
        </p>
        <p align="left">
            &emsp;&emsp;He said, "Your Majesty, the tree's secret lies in the moonlight. The day fruit should be plucked during the daytime when the sun is shining, and the night fruit should be plucked during the nighttime when the moon is out. As long as the fruits are harvested in their respective times, they will retain their qualities."
        </p>
        <p align="left">
            &emsp;&emsp; The king was impressed with Dharmaswami's solution and rewarded him generously. Dharmaswami left the palace, proud of his intellectual achievement.

        <b>
            &emsp;&emsp;However, as Dharmaswami was walking back to his home, he couldn't contain his curiosity. He decided to test his theory immediately. He reached the forest where the magical tree stood, and even though it was nighttime, he plucked a fruit from the tree. As soon as he did, the fruit turned bitter and poisonous. Dharmaswami's greed had clouded his judgment.
        </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>
            &emsp;&emsp;Just then, Betal, who had been hiding on the tree, appeared before Dharmaswami. Betal said, "You let your greed get the better of you, Dharmaswami. You had the correct answer to the riddle, but your impatience and desire for both fruits at once led you to your downfall."
        </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>
            &emsp;&emsp;With that, Betal returned to the tree, leaving Dharmaswami to face the consequences of his actions.

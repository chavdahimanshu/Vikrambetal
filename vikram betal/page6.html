            Once upon a time there lived a king of Ujjayani by name of Dharmadhvaja,
            who had three exquisitely sensitive queens. He loved all three of them very
            much, all of them were of unparalleled beauty.

    &emsp;&emsp;<b>
        On one occasion, while the king was playing with the first queen, he ruffled
        her hair. The lotus flower on her ear fell over her thigh, and made a wound
        and she cried out loud. The king was surprised at her sensitivity and
        immediately requested medical attention for her.

        &emsp;&emsp;<b>
            On another occasion, when he was with the second queen on a full moon night
on the roof of his palace, the queen suddenly felt her skin burning of the
moonlight. The king ordered medical attention for her too and was again
surprised at her sensitivity.

                immediately ordered medical attention for her and was surprised too.

                        Betaal stops and asks King Vikram asks this question: Who among the three
    queens is the most sensitive? Vikram replies with a lot of thought, "The
    third one, as she had not even been touched by the light or flower. She had
    only heard a noise from distance."
